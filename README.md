## YT-Summarizer-Extension

This chrome extension leverages Together.ai API to interact with a LLM (`Llama-3.3-70B`) to summarize the youtube video you are watching in just one click.

## ðŸ§  Why This Exists

Most tools (like Gemini) choke when it comes to summarizing long YouTube videos. The usual workaround involved:
1. Generating a transcript.
2. Feeding it manually to a different AI model.
3. Asking for summaries.
This script kills that pain. One step, one model, fast output.
